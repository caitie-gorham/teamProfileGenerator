# Details

This is a command-line application that allows users to input a series of details about different employees and generate an HTML page that shows those details. The JavaScript utilizes the inquirer package to prompt the user for their inputs and uses the fs package to write the HTML file. This application makes use of modularity to create easy-to-follow code and to separate the creation of classes for each employee type.

This application uses the jest pacakge to do all testing. There are four tests for this application, which can be run in the command line through npm run test.
